To qualify the OSP suite for the prediction of the CYP3A4 DDI potential of new drugs, a set of verified PBPK models of index perpetrators, covering the range from strong CYP3A4 induction to strong inhibition, and respective CYP3A4 DDI victim drugs is specified to set up a CYP3A4-mediated DDI modeling network. 



The following perpetrator compounds were selected: 

-	**Rifampicin** (strong CYP3A4 inducer),
  https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Rifampicin-Model
-	**Efavirenz** (moderate CYP3A4 inducer),
  https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Efavirenz-Model
-	**Fluvoxamine** (weak/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor),
  https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Fluvoxamine-Model
-	**Erythromycin** (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor),
  https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Erythromycin-Model
-	**Clarithromycin** (strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor),
  https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Clarithromycin-Model
-	**Itraconazole** including metabolites (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor),
  https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Itraconazole-Model



The following sensitive CYP3A4 substrates as victim drugs were selected:

-	**Midazolam**,
  https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Midazolam-Model
-	**Triazolam**,
  https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Triazolam-Model
-	**Alprazolam**,
  https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Alprazolam-Model
-	**Alfentanil**,
  https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Alfentanil-Model



**Figure 1** shows the prespecified and developed DDI modeling network of interacting perpetrator and victim drugs for the OSP suite qualification of predicting CYP3A4-mediated DDI.

The following sections give an overview of the clinical studies being part of this qualification report. The respective data identifier (DataID) refers to the **ID** of the dataset in the [OSP PK database](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Database-for-observed-data).
